# Student Marks Prediction:


Using Linear Regression model , we are going to do it.


## Problem Statement:



In this excel file , study hours and students marks are given . 

We have to find the result of student in terms of marks provided his/her study hours.

So using value of student capacity to do study in hours ,
we  are going predict how many marks he or she will get.
## Steps In Project Journey:



We covered all the below steps in this project in detail.

•Business Problem

•Get The Data

•Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights

     Using Seaborn or Matplotlib library ,we can Visualize the data to get 
     instant trend in the data values.

•Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms

     Here , data is in the numeric format only instead categorical data ,
     So we are going to use linear refression machine learning model.

•Select a Model and Train It

•Fine-Tune Your Model

•Present Your Solution

•Launch, Monitor, and Maintain your system
